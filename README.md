# Astrobox
a space sandbox game written in C++ using the SFML library. I am a beginner to C++ so it is probrably not the greatest game. I hope to have friends contribute to this in some way.

The Astrobox folder is for my codeblocks setup
It also houses the game executable under the /build folder
Note that for now the exe file doesn't correctly load the assets :(

/src holds the source code
/lib and /include house the sfml libraries
