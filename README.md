# Astrobox
This project is space sandbox game written in C++ using the SFML library. I am a beginner to C++ and the only C++ project I have created before this one was very small. I have a good amount of comments in the source code right now so if you are interested in programming or experienced feel free to explore. I hope to have friends contribute to this in the future, although right now I don't know what I could have other people help with. Feel free to fork the repository and explore or make changes, though.

[Just download the exe file](https://github.com/Jayx20/Astrobox/raw/master/Astrobox/build/Astrobox.exe)
Sadly this game is Windows only at the moment, as much as I love Linux it is easier to work with just Windows.


/src holds the source code
/lib and /include house the sfml libraries

The Astrobox folder is for my codeblocks setup and holds the exe
