# Astrobox
a space sandbox game written in C++ using the SFML library. I am a beginner to C++ so it is probrably not the greatest game. I hope to have friends contribute to this in some way.

[Just download the exe file](https://github.com/Jayx20/Astrobox/raw/master/Astrobox/build/Astrobox.exe)

The Astrobox folder is for my codeblocks setup and holds the exe

/src holds the source code
/lib and /include house the sfml libraries
